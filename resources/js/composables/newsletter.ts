 * The subscribeEmail and subscribePhone functions are asynchronous and return nothing.
 * The isLoading property is a boolean that indicates whether a subscription request is
 * being processed.
 *
 * The subscribeEmail function takes an email address and an optional success callback.

 * The error messages are as follows:
 * - If the request is invalid, the form errors will be displayed.
 * - If the request is valid but results in an error, a generic error message will be
